      <Center><h3>Goal</h3></center>
        The main goal of sta141b is for students to gain experience through data science projects. This is done with learning SQL, web scraping, using APIs, data visualization, and more.
        In this course, there were 6 mini projects and one final, group project. Programming in this class was in Python.
        <ul>
          <li><b>Assignment 1</b>: In this assignment we had to program an algorithm for calculating Doomsday. Once that was done, I wrote a method that determines the day of the week for a given date.
          Lastly, a function that calculates how many birthdays occured in each month/day in 1978. To see my algorithm check out my <a href = "assignment1.html">iPython Notebook</a></li>
          <li><b>Assignment 2</b>:In this assignment we used the SVD algorithm to change the color of an image of a cat. Code is <a href = "assignment2.html"> here</a>.</li>
          <li><b>Assignment 3</b>:This time we took a large dataset from the US Department of Agriculture and did some analysis on it. Like which fruit is most expensive, etc. Check out my analysis <a href = "assignment3.html"> here</a>.</li>
          <li><b>Assignment 4</b>: In this assignment we used the USDA Food Composition Database API to retreive data for more analysis on agriculture. Check out my analysis <a href = "assignment4.html"> here</a>.</li>
          <li><b>Assignment 5</b>: In this assignment we webscrapped The Aggie using Beautiful Soup and used NLTK package to do some language analysis on the tokenized words. Check out my analysis <a href = "assignment5.html"> here</a>.</li>
          <li><b>Assignment 6</b>: In this assignment we did an analysis on multiple tables stored in a sqlite database. We tried to see if there was any correlation between the tables (things like crime rate and school location in San Francisco). Check out my analysis <a href = "assignment6.html"> here</a>.</li>
          <li><b>Final Project</b>: My group consisted of Ryan Brady, Shirley Chew, and Kathleen Zhen. Together we used the Beautiful Soup package to webscrape from 9 different news outlets to see their opinion of Trump. We split up the news sources into three categories: liberal, conservative, and other. We wanted to
            see whether the liberal news sources had a negative view of Trump, the conservative news sources had a positive view of Trump, and the other news sources were unopinionated. To see our results, check out our <a href = "https://noashadmon.github.io/sta141bfinal/">project</a>.

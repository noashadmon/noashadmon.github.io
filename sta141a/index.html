      <Center><h3>Goal</h3></center>
        As stated on the STA141A website, the goal of the course is for students become proficient in data manipulation and exploratory data analysis, and finding and conveying features of interest. They learn to map mathematical descriptions of statistical procedures to code, decompose a problem into sub-tasks, and to create reusable functions. They develop ability to transform complex data as text into data structures amenable to analysis. They learn how and why to simulate random processes, and are introduced to statistical methods they do not see in other courses.

          <li>In this assignment we were given training and testing data to predict what type of flower one is given using k-nearest neighbors Analysis. To see my analysis check out my <a href="Homework5.pdf">project</a>.</li>
          <li>For my final project I took a large dataset of credit card information (how much each person paid per month, etc) to create a model where I could predict if a person defaulted or not. To check ot my analysis click <a href = "final.pdf"> here.</a></li>
